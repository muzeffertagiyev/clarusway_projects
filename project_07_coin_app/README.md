# Crypto Coin App

This project is a dynamic and interactive application designed to search and display cryptocurrency details, including their prices, symbols, and performance changes. The app uses real-time data fetched from the CoinRanking API and showcases it in an intuitive user interface.

## Project Overview

The **Crypto Coin App** allows users to:
- Search for a cryptocurrency by name or symbol.
- View detailed information about the cryptocurrency, such as price, performance change, and symbol.
- Add multiple cryptocurrencies to a list and remove them when needed.

The app is developed with a clean and responsive design, ensuring seamless usage across devices.

- **SweetAlert2**: For enhanced alert and message handling.

## Learning Highlights
Through this project, I gained experience in:
- Fetching and managing real-time data from external APIs.
- Handling asynchronous operations with `async/await`.
- Improving user experience with error handling and alerts using **SweetAlert2**.
- Managing dynamic DOM updates with JavaScript.
- Designing responsive layouts using **SASS**.

## How It Works
1. Users type a cryptocurrency name or symbol into the search field and submit the form.
2. The app fetches data from the CoinRanking API and displays the relevant cryptocurrency.
3. Users can add cryptocurrencies to the list, view their details, and remove them as needed.
4. Dynamic color coding indicates performance changes (green for positive and red for negative).
